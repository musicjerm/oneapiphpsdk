Please answer the following questions about your work:

0 - What language did you program in?
<br>*PHP version 8*

1 - Have you manually tested the SDK?
<br>*Yes*

2 - Did you add a test suite? If so, how will we use it? If not, why?
<br>*Yes three tests are included, PHPUnit should be installed at the project level.  See the testing section in the readme file.* 

3 - Did you use any 3rd party library? Why did you use it? What are the tradeoffs?
<br>*No*

4 - Do you feel this SDK makes it easier to interact with the API?
<br>*Absolutely, it creates abstraction from the more complicated api calls with simplified methods.*

5 - If you had more time, what else would you add?
<br>*Prettier docs, demo application, additional query options for sorting, paging, search by name etc.*

6 - What would you change in your current SDK solution?
<br>*I feel like this is the best way I could do it.*

7 - On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the highest), how would you rate this solution?
<br>**10**

8 - Anything else we should keep in mind when we evaluate the project?
<br>*For installation, I used packagist / composer to make the process as easy as possible.  In order to do this, I had to host the code on a public repo as I don't have the ability to set up a private package for installation.  The code is hosted on my personal github, and is identical to what I have submitted.*
