# Design of MusicJerm/OneApiPhpSdk

This SDK uses an object-oriented approach and has been designed to be a small, easy to use, efficient library.

It has been designed with clever class and method names to help the end user remember what objects are available and how to use the tool in general.

The SDK has been created with simplicity in mind.  The only things an end user must know are their API key and what data they need to access.  The main client model can be used with only a single argument, or up to 3 depending on the necessary data.

As the client object has been created to handle all data types in the same manner, there is only one query method.
